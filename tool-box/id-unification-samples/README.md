# ID Unification Workflow Samples

ID Unification is the process of stitching together multiple tables using various identifiers to assign a unique customer ID (canonical_id or persistent_id) to each user. In simpler terms, it consolidates identifiers like cookie_id and email addresses from various user data sources to identify and group "the same person."

Since customer data often contains different identifiers across different data sources, simply aggregating this data doesn't link these sources together. This necessitates the ID Unification process to make the data usable.

These workflow samples are used for the following API documentation
