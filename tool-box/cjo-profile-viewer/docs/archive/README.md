# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the development process. These files have been superseded by the consolidated guides in the main docs directory.

## Archived Content

### Implementation History (`implementation-history/`)

Contains step-by-step implementation documentation that was created during feature development:

- **Merge Step Implementation** (6 files):
  - `BREADCRUMB_FLOW_SUMMARY.md`
  - `COMPLETE_BREADCRUMB_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  - `CONSISTENT_GROUPING_HEADERS.md`
  - `GROUPING_HEADER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  - `MERGE_HIERARCHY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  - `MERGE_STEPS_GUIDE.md`

- **UI Implementation** (2 files):
  - `INDENTATION_FIX.md`
  - `INDENTATION_VERIFICATION.md`

- **Technical Details** (1 file):
  - `UUID_SHORTENING_SUMMARY.md`

## Current Documentation

The content from these archived files has been consolidated into:

1. **`STEP_TYPES_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide to all 7 CJO step types including merge steps
2. **`UI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete UI patterns and formatting rules
3. **`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`** - Updated with consolidated project information

## Why These Were Archived

These documents represented an iterative development approach where each feature improvement was documented separately. While valuable for understanding the development history, they created:

- **Documentation Fragmentation**: 9 separate files for related concepts
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Multiple files to update for changes
- **User Confusion**: Difficult to find comprehensive information
- **Architectural Mismatch**: Merge steps treated as special case rather than standard step type

The new consolidated structure provides better organization and maintainability while preserving all the valuable implementation knowledge.
