## Steps to send a new box or fix a existing box

### Fork the code

Firstly you need a local fork of the the project, so go ahead and press the “fork” button in GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you’ll see a note that it’s been forked underneath the project name.

### Download the code

Now you need a copy locally, so find the “Clone with HTTPS” in the right hand column and use that to clone locally using a terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/treasure-data/treasure-boxes.git
```

### Create a new branch

Firest, change into the new project’s directory: 

```
$ cd treasure-boxes
```

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

```
$ git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

The name of the branch does not need to have the word add in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now that you have the source code, get it working on your computer.
Choose a box you want to contribute, and make a new foloder under the box you choose.
The box is expected to contain at least README.md and one source code file you want to contribute as a Box.

### Add your change to the branch

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.
Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:

```
$ git add <YOU ADDED FILE>
```

Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

```
$ git commit -m "Add XXXX as a new Box"
```

### Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command git push:

```
$ git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.
Soon the Treasure Boxes team will be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
