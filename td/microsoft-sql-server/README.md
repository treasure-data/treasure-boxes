# Workflow: td example (Result Output to Microsoft SQL Server)

This example workflow exports TD job results into SQL Server, using [Treasure Data's Writing Job Results into SQL Server tables](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/result-into-microsoft-sql-server) with [td](http://docs.digdag.io/operators/td.html) operator.

# How to Run

First, please upload your workflow project by td wf push command.

    # Upload
    $ td wf push sample_project

Second, please set Microsoft Azure credentials by `td wf secrets` command.

    # Set Secrets
    $ td wf secrets --project sample_project --set sqlserver.password=xyzxyzxyzxyz

    # Set Secrets on your local for testing
    $ td wf secrets --local --set sqlserver.password=xyzxyzxyzxyz

Now you can reference these credentials by `${secret:}` syntax in the dig file.

You can trigger the session manually.

    # Run
    $ td wf start sample_project td_sql_server --session now
