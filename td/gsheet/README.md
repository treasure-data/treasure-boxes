# Workflow: td example (Result Output to Google Sheets)

This example workflow exports TD job results into a Google Sheets with [td](http://docs.digdag.io/operators/td.html) operator.

# Prerequisites

You need to create a new Authentication for Google Sheets in advance.
Please refer to the section '2. Account authentication' in the [Treasure Data Documentation](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009671913-Writing-Job-Results-to-Google-Sheets) in order to find the procedure.

The connection name is used in the dig file.


# How to Run

First, please upload your workflow project by `td wf push` command.

    # Upload
    $ td wf push td_gsheet

If you want to mask setting, please set it by `td wf secrets` command. For more details, please see [digdag documentation](http://docs.digdag.io/command_reference.html#secrets)

    # Set Secrets
    $ td wf secrets --project td_gsheet --set key

    # Set Secrets on your local for testing
    $ td wf secrets --local --set key

Now you can use these secrets by `${secret:}` syntax in the dig file.

You can trigger the session manually.

    # Run
    $ td wf start td_gsheet td_gsheet --session now

## Local mode

    # Run
    $ td wf run td_gsheet.dig

# Supplemental

Available parameters for `result_settings` are here.

- spreadsheet_id: (string, required if `spreadsheet_title` does not exist)

**Note:** Google API has another threshold of 10MB for request payload. Plugin will automatically detect which threshold reaches first.
