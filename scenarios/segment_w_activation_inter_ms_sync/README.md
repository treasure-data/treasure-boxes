# Segment sync (inter master segment replication) with activation via Activation Actions

----
## Overview

This project provides a solution to replicating segments from one master segment to another using Activation Actions.

----
## Implementation
1. Copy and paste the code into a custom script in Treasure Workflows.

----
## Considerations

This project doesn't handle "Drag-on Rules: Segment Include/Exclude" segment rules where the target parent segment's structure is different from the source parent segment's in regards to the segment(s) referenced in such segment rules.
